My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).

## OBSOLETE

This project was made with "egui immediate mode GUI", but I don't really like that.  
I will rewrite the project with "iced retained mode GUI".  

## Backup

My friend has a laptop with 1TB space for his data.  
Then a super tiny and extremely fast Samsung T7 Shield 2TB external SSD as primary backup.  
And then a big old 2TB external HDD as secondary backup. It is so big that it has it's own power.  

The difference in storage size makes the backup tricky. Not impossible, but a notch more complicated that he would like.

I was thinking of using `robocopy` for the backup, but as always it lacks a feature that I would like to have.
When the files are deleted on the `original` disk I want to save these files on the backup disk for possible recovery later. Robocopy just delete them. I know there exists the windows recycle bin, but I don't want to use that.  

First the program will check what disks are connected. The names of the folders are fixed so I can recognize them easily. There are 3 different backups:

1. from the laptop d:\original1 to e:\backup1_of_original1
2. from the laptop d:\original1 to f:\backup2_of_original1
3. from the primary backup e:\original2 to f:\backup_of_original2

The files that should be deleted will be moved into a folder named `deleted_on_backup_datetime`. This can be reviewed and finally manually delete when not needed any more.

I will use `robocopy` to list the files to be deleted. Then I will parse the output and move these files.
Then I will use `robocopy` to make a "mirror backup". Sounds easy.

## GUI for windows

My friend is not a computer guy, so I decided that a CLI program in a terminal is not for him. He is comfortable to use GUI programs in Windows.

I experimented with the crate `egui` to create a super simple GUI program for Windows, but I don't like the "immediate mode GUI".  
I will rewrite it using "iced retained mode GUI".

## Cross compile to windows

On my machine I have Windows11 with WSL/Debian. I will cross compile to Windows, copy the exe file with `scp` and run it on Windows.  

I use `cargo-auto` for automation of the build process and to commit to GitHub. Just run `cargo auto` and follow the instructions. To work with GitHub it will need the Personal Access Token from <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.  

Copy the exe file from the container 'crustde' to win folder. Run in windows git-bash:

```bash
scp rustdevuser@crustde:/home/rustdevuser/rustprojects/backup_for_zeljko_egui/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/backup_for_zeljko_egui.exe /c/Users/Luciano/rustprojects/backup_for_zeljko_egui/

# then run in git-bash
cd ~/rustprojects/backup_for_zeljko_egui
./backup_for_zeljko_egui.exe
```

## Robocopy

Robocopy stands for "Robust copy" in Windows. It is good.  
First I want to list the files that should be deleted.  
Then I will parse the output and move these files instead of delete them.  
In the output I must recognize the files that start with the `destination` folder.

```bash
robocopy options
/L :: List only - don't copy, timestamp or delete any files.
/X :: report all eXtra files, not just those selected.
/FP :: include Full Pathname of files in the output.
/NS :: No Size - don't log file sizes.
/NC :: No Class - don't log file classes.
/NDL :: No Directory List - don't log directory names.

robocopy d:\original1 d:\backup1_of_original1 /MIR /L /X /FP /NS /NC /NDL

The output is terrible to parse:
